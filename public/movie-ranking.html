    <h1>My favourite movies of all time</h1>
    <h2>Top 3 movies</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Tenet</h3>
    <p>
        I really liked the heroism, especially at the end of the movie. The secrecy about the identity of the person who
        sacrifies themself to save the main characters, as in order to have the world saved, they needed to succeed.
    </p>
    <h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
    <p>
        The historic element of the movie was fairly new to me, as I haven't dug myself quite deep into the events of
        inventing the first Atomic Bomb. It was good to see what Oppenheimer went through, as before I saw this movie, I
        only, and barely, knew Oppenheimer as the father of the Atomic Bomb. This well presented story helped me get a
        better understanding of the power plays between the Soviet Union and the United States.
    </p>
    <h3>Inception</h3>
    <p>
        At the time, in 2010, I started to realise how interested I am in how the mind works. Inception helped me
        understand how important it is to be in control of one's mind, as it can play tricks on itself that can have
        devistated effects on other people. Especially on who we love the most.
