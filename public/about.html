<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Máté. 
  I'm a Full Stack Developer with years of experience working in the hospitality industry, as a waiter, receptionist and then manager.
  In my last role, I took initiative to improve workflow within the department, when I relised I like to, and really good at, solving problems.
  As I studied programming back in high school, where my creativity and curiousity took me all the way to create a small labirinth game, I now realised that I have become mature enough to utilise my previous experiences to improve the industry. 
  <br /><i>I had some more studying to do...</i>
</p>

<p>
  I <i>always</i> wanted a family, and a house. <br />
  When I moved to the UK, and changed profession, I pretty much had to start and build my life from ground up.
  I had a quite fresh diploma in English, B2 I believe, but as living in Hungary, working with only Hungarian speaking people,
  I had very little conversational experience in English. This is my 6th year(in 2024) working and living the the UK,
  and now I feel more confident with the way of life than ever in Hungary.

  Last year, in the very beggining of 2023, me and my fiancée made some plans to save enough money to travel together
  to the countries we both wanted to. We wanted to build our relationship, create a stronger bond.
  We also planned to save money for about a year to buy a house.
  A few week after setting these plans into motion, we found out we are going to have a baby girl.
  As you can imagine, whole sort of emotions took over me. For a little while my 100% stable life became a roller coaster.
  Out of all the plans one thing happened for sure: creating a strong bond between me and my fiancée.

  This past year was not easy. Bought a house that very much needed some refurbishing before being able to live in it.
  With not much help, not much prior experience, but with my heavily pregnant fiancée we moved into our first home,
  where we did not have a kitchen, and a half ready bed room. I was working full-time at the time and used up all my holidays for the year.
  <br /><i>I knew, I had to make it work, doesn't matter how hard it was.</i>
